You can explore GitHub repositories that showcase custom GPT implementations and fine-tunings. A popular example is the Hugging Face Transformers repository, which provides tools for building and fine-tuning language models, including GPT variants.

Another interesting repository is EleutherAI's GPT-Neo, which offers models similar to OpenAI's GPT-3 that you can customize.

You can also check out the OpenAI Cookbook, which has examples and best practices for using GPT models.
